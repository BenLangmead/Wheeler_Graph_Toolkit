This test is to analyze how the execution time of the WG varies as
a function of the edge probability. This particular test analyzed WG
with 60 nodes, with edge probabilities ranging from .05 to .45 in steps 
of .05

To replicate this test with new data, from this directory, run 
the test_1.sh script: 

This will first generate new WG samples, and then perform the timing analysis.
