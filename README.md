## Recognizer

Within the recognizer folder, WG samples can be generated by providing the number of samples desired as the first argument, and the approximate node count for the graph as the second argument. 

### 1. Building the latest version from `src/`

```
cd ./recognizer/src/
make
```

### 2. Running recognizer


```
Usage:

  recognizer  <in.dot>  [wg_recognizer_method]  [stop_condition]  [print_invalid]
```

```
Options:

  wg_recognizer_method : the recognizer algorithm. 'm1' is the exponential algorithm; 
                         'm2' is the one scan through algorithm (still under development)
                         'm1' or 'm2'. The default is 'm1'.
  
  stop_condition       : whether to find one set of node labels and stop or all sets of correct node labels.
                         'early_stop' or 'normal'. The default is 'early_stop'.
                         
  print_invalid        : whether to print out the invalid wheeler graph log during node labels permutation. 
                         '0' or '1'. The default is '0'.
```
